			<p>In an era where attention spans seem to be shrinking faster than ever, the landscape of music seems to not just mirroring but capitalizing off this trend. The days of deeper, more intricate albums spanning track counts in the 20s and beyond appear to be dwindling into obscurity, making way for a new norm: shorter, simpler, and “trendier” musical experiences. From the vinyl era's lavish and elegant LPs to the CD boom's extensive and powerful tracklists, the evolution of music albums has taken a sharp turn toward brevity. But why is it that artists are opting for concise, bite-sized offerings over more expansive sonic experiences? Join me, as I present some of the research and analysis I’ve done in an attempt to better comprehend this cultural shift, breaking some potential reasonings for this as well as what can be expected out of the industry’s future.</p>

			<h3>The Modern Musician's Big Three</h3>
			<p>When looking into why exactly we are seeing this trend, I identified three key reasons (the modern musician's big three) as to why newer artists are focusing on making tracks shorter: attention span, streaming revenue, and virality. 

		<div class="list">
			<ol>
				<li>Attention Span:  this is undoubtedly one of if not the most crucial factors in this shift towards shorter music. Studies consistently have shown a significant decline in human attention spans, a consequence attributed in part to the overall proliferation of digital media and multitasking. Musical artists have gone on to recognize the need to capture and maintain listeners' attention within a far shorter timeframe, crafting songs that hit hard and fast, leaving a lasting impact in a limited span of time.</li>
				<li>Streaming revenue: this plays a pivotal role in shaping the length of tracks and in the end albums. Major music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music compensate artists based on the total number of streams their songs can accumulate. As a result, shorter tracks will often result in more frequent plays, potentially boosting the artist's revenue as well as visibility in an industry where both can be difficult to come by</li>
				<li>Virality: last but certainly not least. The quest for virality is one which certainly influences the decision to create shorter music. In an age where quick, trendy, and viral content rule supreme, shorter, catchier songs are far more likely to gain any sort of traction on social media platforms. Whether it's through a dance challenge on a platform such as TikTok or repostable snippets on Instagram or Twitter, creating more concise tracks gives artists a higher probability of going viral, and thus can help smaller musicians gain more recognition and a larger audience.</li>
			</ol>
		    These three factors collectively contribute to the creation of a music landscape where brevity is not just valued, but in fact strategically employed by these artists and labels in an attempt to engage the most amount of listeners, maximize their earnings, and enhance the likelihood of one of their songs or albums becoming a viral sensation in this ever-evolving a constantly changing digital ecosystem.

			<h2>Where's the proof?</h2>
			Regarding the truth behind a collective attention span decrease across the world, countless researchers have looked into the subject. Among those researchers, as shared by an article on DeseretNews.com, was the Technical University of Denmark, which underwent a study concluding with the result that the collective global attention span is narrowing due to the vast amount of information that is so frequently presented to the public. Stating in their findings that “people now have more things to focus on — but often focus on things for short periods of time.”</p>
            <p>
			Deviating from the theme of attention, how true is it to state that music is in fact getting progressively shorter? To provide a solid answer to this question, I found some data regarding the length of each of the top ten best-selling albums of each year from 1990-2021. After crunching some numbers I constructed the graph below, which demonstrates the average length of the ten collective albums of each year, and on a grander scale, the gradual decrease in album length over the past thirty years.</p>

	</iframe>
	        After analyzing the graph, there are quite a few notable findings and conclusions that may be drawn. Looking at the line graph broadly, one can quickly notice a decreasing trend, with the average top 10 best-selling album length going from just under an hour (55.87 minutes) in 1990, to being almost ten full minutes shorter (47.69 minutes) 31 years later in 2021. Beyond this, one can also note the ever-fluctuating state of the music industry, with album-length typically interchanging between longer and shorter run times on an every-other-year basis. This can also be seen through the 21 changes in direction the line sees over this period, showing constant change but with a noticeable yet gradual decrease at the end.

			<h3>Through the Eyes of an Artist</h3>
			<p>To get a better grasp on the topic at hand, I looked to interview an individual who would have not only a different perspective than mine but hopefully a more expert one as well. This was when I realized the perfect subject for my interview: who better to speak about music than an actual musician?</p>

            <p> After doing some research on the local music scene, my attention was caught by a flashy pop-rock band from the late 70s. With so many years of experience, I was certain that the band’s members would have some intriguing thoughts on the topic, so after a few messages back and forth I was able to have a conversation with Syracuse Music Hall of Fame inductee and lead vocalist and bassist of the power pop band <i>The Flashcubes</i>, Gary Frenay.</p>

            <p>Frenay gave many noteworthy insights as well as a different potential reason as to why exactly music seems to be shortening. When asked about the intentionality behind the length of the bands' music, he explained how at the start they had their hands tied, “with vinyl, there were physical restrictions as to what you could put on a singular album.“ In an era where record players and jukeboxes dominated the music scene, it was difficult to produce longer, more elaborate tracklists, leaving The Flashcubes with no option other than to choose quality over quantity.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p><iframe title="Number of Top Ten Selling Records per Genre from 1990-2021" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-dlyad" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dlyad/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="305" data-external="1">
            </iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>

            <p>Furthermore, Frenay and I also discussed the band's genre, “pop rock”, as being a major contributor to the group's shorter tracklists and runtimes. “We were trying to record a song that was catchy” he explained, “you wanted to have a hook… something that you can hang your ear on.” This is something that can be connected to the overarching boom of pop in the music industry. In a genre so focused on creating something people will find remarkable and be able to sing along to, it only makes sense that a higher number of songs in a shorter amount of time would be their end product. As seen in the graph below, the “pop boom” is a clear one, with the genre absolutely dominating the charts over the past thirty years, so it is no surprise that with its rise, longer songs are slowly but surely seeing their demise.</p>
